<p>Hi, my name is Alberto Sadde (aesadde). I recently graduated from the MSc in Computer Science at Oxford University where I focused Functional Programming and got interested in Machine Learning.</p>
<p>I am interested in these areas as well as general software engineering. I am always looking for opportunities to further my technical abilities and gain managerial skills. Feel free to <a href="mailto:albertosadde@gmail.com">contact me</a>.</p>
<p>You can check what I’ve been up to recently by looking at my <a href="./now.html">Now</a> page. You can also check some of my latest <a href="./projects.html">Projects</a> or you can read my <a href="./blog.html">Blog</a> where from time to time I share what I think and write about topics and problems that I find interesting.</p>
<h2 id="short-bio">Short Bio</h2>
<p>Alberto was born in Venezuela were he studied and lived until he was 20 years old. After two years at Universidad Simón Bolívar in Caracas, Venezuela studying Computer Engineering, he transferred to the UK to study Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of York. As part of his programme, he worked at BAE Systems’ Advanced Technology Centre as a Research Scientist focusing on parallel and GPU programming. More recently, Alberto graduated from the MSc in Computer Science at Oxford University.</p>
<p>Other than Computer Science and Mathematics Alberto enjoys all sorts of sports, especially if they are outdoor or if there is water involved. He is always trying to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_rugby">Underwater Rugby</a> and loves introducing people to the sport.</p>
