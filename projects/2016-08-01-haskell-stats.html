This is a project that spawned from a collections of scripts that I used to gather data for my masters thesis. It is an ongoing project and its far from complete.

<span class="proj-info">Objectives:</span>
<ul>
<li>
To provide a query engine (in the style of Hoogle) that gives information about all Hackage packages.
<li>
The engine will provide ways to gather information such as most used and downloaded packages and modules; most called functions;
</ul>
<span class="proj-info">Current Status:</span>
<ul>
<li>
Architecture change: the current version of the engine assumes a downloaded list of packages. We are working to use directly the hackage database.
<li>
API: we are building an extensible API so that users can implement their own queries on the data.
</ul>
